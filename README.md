# OOP_Dataflow_Project

The project for a course of Object oriented programming. Simulating a simple system with Dataflow architecture. 

One part of the project was implementing a “compiler” for a simple program consisting of mathematical expressions that take some time to execute. The compilation is optimized so that execution takes the least amount of time possible. The second part was implementing a “machine” that executes the code while all variables are saved in “memory”. Saving the variables also takes time and the number of variables that can be written in memory at the same time is limited. This was also taken into consideration when optimizing the “compiler”.

The project was written in C++
